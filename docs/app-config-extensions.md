# App config extensions

This document describes TIBCO® Developer Hub custom extensions to the `app-config.yaml` schema.

These are also described in the [`config.d.ts` file](../config.d.ts) with more details about each field.

## Build Info

Show the build number at the bottom of the Home Page UI.

Example config:

```yaml
app:
  title: The TIBCO Hub
  baseUrl: http://localhost:3000
  showBuildVersion: true
```

The CI/CD pipeline automatically adds the build number to all docker images.

## Catalog Refresh Delay

GitHub rate limits API requests to 5,000 per hour (or more for Enterprise accounts). The default catalog backend refreshes data every 100 seconds, which issues an API request for each discovered location.

This means if you have more than ~140 catalog entities, you may get throttled by rate limiting. You can change the refresh rate of the catalog in by using the example config:

```yaml
catalogRefreshDelayInSec: 300
```

Allowed range is 100 to 900 milliseconds. Increase the rate limit to avoid throttling from GitHub API.

## Walk Through

Show the Walk-through card on home page if the config is present.

Example config:

```yaml
walkThrough:
  viewAllLink: 'http://www.some-external-link.com'
  items:
    - title: 'Walk Through 1'
      tags: ['Tag1', 'Tag2']
      text: 'Some description'
      link: 'http://www.some-external-link.com/walk-through1'
    - title: 'Walk Through 2'
      tags: ['Tag1', 'Tag2']
      text: 'Some description'
      link: 'http://www.some-external-link.com/walk-through2'
```

## Walk Through

      text: 'Some description'
      link: 'http://www.some-external-link.com/walk-through2'
```

## Cp Link

Control plane link for the TIBCO® Developer Hub.

Example config:

```

No need to provide this in configuration.
This is filled automatically while provisioning TIBCO® Developer Hub for a data plane.
